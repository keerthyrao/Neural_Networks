Program-1 // – Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it.
Here in this program first the user has to enter the string as an input. All the letters will be then converted into list of characters.Now we are going to generate a random number to know the number of indexes that we are going to delete from the string. then we are runinmg a for loop to generate the number of indexes till we reach the random index number in each iteration and deleting the corresponding character for the index generating. Finally we are reversing the resultant string and printing it as an output.//  

Program-2 // - Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’ User has to enter a sentence which is in string format.lower function is used to convert all the upper case letters into lowercase letters.now the replace function is used inoder to replace each occurence of "python" with "pythons" 

Programe- 3 // - Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use the grading scheme we are using in this class. 
First we have to input a score and then we need to calculate the percentage of the score.Now using if and elif blocks perncentage is classified into the respective grades.Finally the corrospondent grade is printed. Grades are classidied as shown below 90%-100% is graded as A 80%-89% is graded as B 70%-79% is graded as C 60%-69% is graded as D Below 60%5 is garded as F.

program-1// Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to fullname function that should return the (full name). o For example: ▪ First_name = “your first name”, last_name = “your last name” ▪ Full_name = “your full name” o Write function named “string_alternative” that returns every other char in the full_name string. Str = “Good evening” Output: Go vnn Note: You need to create a function named “string_alternative” for this program and call it from main function.
This Python program prompts the user to input their first and last names. It then defines a function called fullname that takes these names as parameters, concatenates them to form a full name, and prints the result. The full name is stored in a global variable called full_name.After that, another function named string_alternative is defined, which takes the full_name as a parameter and prints an alternative string that consists of every second character from the full name.Finally, the program calls these functions with the user-inputted names and displays the full name and its alternative string.

program-2// Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output. o Finally store the output in output.txt file
In this code we are defining a function called count_word. It reads text from an "input.txt" file, separates the text into sentences, and adds extra blank lines between sentences. Then, it counts the occurrences of each word, writes the sentences with added lines to an "output.txt" file, and appends a section with the word counts. Finally, the function closes the files, and when count_word() is called, it executes this process.

Program-3// Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) customers into a list and convert these heights to centimeters in a separate list using:
Nested Interactive loop.
List comprehensions 
In this code it takes input from the user as a space-separated list of inches.It converts each inch in the list to centimeters using the conversion factor of 2.54 (since 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters).Here we are using map  function to convert each string element in the list to an integer.Finally after conversion it prints the resulting list of centimeter values.




Assignment 3
Here is the Recording link with the clear expalnation:

Program-1// 
Create a class Employee and then do the following
• Create a data member to count the number of Employees
• Create a constructor to initialize name, family, salary, department
• Create a function to average salary
• Create a Fulltime Employee class and it should inherit the properties of Employee class
• Create the instances of Fulltime Employee class and Employee class and call their member functions

->First, we need tp define a class named Employee that includes a data member to track the number of employees. The __init__ method initializes object attributes, with 'self' representing the instance of the class. 
Then a function called average_salary is then created to calculate the average salary by summing up all employee salaries.
Next, we introduce the FullTimeEmployee class as a subclass of Employee, using the super() function to access data from the parent class. In the main function, data for both FullTimeEmployee and Employee instances is appended to the femployee[] and employee[] lists, respectively. Finally, the average salary for both full-time employees and employees is printed.


Program-2//
Using NumPy create random vector of size 20 having only float in the range 1-20.
Then reshape the array to 4 by 5
Then replace the max in each row by 0 (axis=1)

->First we need to create a random vector of size 20 with float values of range 1-20. Now we import numpy module as np, and we are using np.random.uniform() function to create array filled with random values. Then we used reshape() function to reshape the array as 4 by 5 matrix and also using max function inorder to find the maximum value in each row and repalcing it with 0. keepdims parameter of NumPy  enables us to control the dimensions of the output and axis =1 states the directions of rows along columns and finally printing the resultant vector.
