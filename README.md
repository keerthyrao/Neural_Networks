Program-1 // – Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it.
Here in this program first the user has to enter the string as an input. All the letters will be then converted into list of characters.Now we are going to generate a random number to know the number of indexes that we are going to delete from the string. then we are runinmg a for loop to generate the number of indexes till we reach the random index number in each iteration and deleting the corresponding character for the index generating. Finally we are reversing the resultant string and printing it as an output.//  

Program-2 // - Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’ User has to enter a sentence which is in string format.lower function is used to convert all the upper case letters into lowercase letters.now the replace function is used inoder to replace each occurence of "python" with "pythons" 

Programe- 3 // - Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use the grading scheme we are using in this class. 
First we have to input a score and then we need to calculate the percentage of the score.Now using if and elif blocks perncentage is classified into the respective grades.Finally the corrospondent grade is printed. Grades are classidied as shown below 90%-100% is graded as A 80%-89% is graded as B 70%-79% is graded as C 60%-69% is graded as D Below 60%5 is garded as F.




Assignment 2

program-1// Write a program that takes two strings from the user: first_name, last_name. Pass these variables to fullname function that should return the (full name). o For example: ▪ First_name = “your first name”, last_name = “your last name” ▪ Full_name = “your full name” o Write function named “string_alternative” that returns every other char in the full_name string. Str = “Good evening” Output: Go vnn Note: You need to create a function named “string_alternative” for this program and call it from main function.
This Python program prompts the user to input their first and last names. It then defines a function called fullname that takes these names as parameters, concatenates them to form a full name, and prints the result. The full name is stored in a global variable called full_name.After that, another function named string_alternative is defined, which takes the full_name as a parameter and prints an alternative string that consists of every second character from the full name.Finally, the program calls these functions with the user-inputted names and displays the full name and its alternative string.

program-2// Write a python program to find the wordcount in a file (input.txt) for each line and then print the output. o Finally store the output in output.txt file
In this code we are defining a function called count_word. It reads text from an "input.txt" file, separates the text into sentences, and adds extra blank lines between sentences. Then, it counts the occurrences of each word, writes the sentences with added lines to an "output.txt" file, and appends a section with the word counts. Finally, the function closes the files, and when count_word() is called, it executes this process.

Program-3// Write a program, which reads heights (inches.) customers into a list and convert these heights to centimeters in a separate list using:
Nested Interactive loop.
List comprehensions 
In this code it takes input from the user as a space-separated list of inches.It converts each inch in the list to centimeters using the conversion factor of 2.54 (since 1 inch equals 2.54 centimeters).Here we are using map  function to convert each string element in the list to an integer.Finally after conversion it prints the resulting list of centimeter values.
